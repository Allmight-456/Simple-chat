#### Features

- Real-time messaging using socket.io
- User joining and leaving notifications
- Customizable user names

#### Target Audience

Simple-Chat is designed for anyone who needs a simple and reliable chat application, including individuals, small teams, and businesses.

### **2. Setup Instructions**

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js version 16 or higher
- npm package manager

#### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/username/simple-chat.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd simple-chat
```
3. Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

#### Configuration

No additional configuration is required.

#### Environment Setup

Simple-Chat can be run in both development and production environments. For development, use the following command:

```
npm run devStart
```

This command will start the development server on port 3000.

#### First-Time Run

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You will see a chat interface where you can enter your name and start chatting.

### **3. Core Modules and Architecture**

#### Components

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that displays the chat interface.
- **package.json**: The project's package configuration file.
- **README.md**: The project's documentation file.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that handles the client-side functionality.
- **server.js**: The JavaScript file that handles the server-side functionality.

#### Relationships

- The `index.html` file includes the `script.js` file, which handles the client-side functionality.
- The `script.js` file connects to the server using socket.io.
- The `server.js` file listens for incoming connections and manages the chat functionality.

#### Key Functionalities

- **index.html**: Displays the chat interface and allows users to enter their names and send messages.
- **script.js**: Handles the connection to the server, sends messages, and displays received messages.
- **server.js**: Manages user connections, broadcasts messages, and handles user disconnections.

#### Internal Architecture

Simple-Chat has a simple and straightforward architecture. The client-side is responsible for displaying the chat interface and handling user input. The server-side is responsible for managing user connections, broadcasting messages, and handling user disconnections.

### **4. API Endpoints**

Simple-Chat does not have any API endpoints.

### **5. Usage Examples**

#### Common Use Cases

- **Chatting with friends or colleagues**: Simple-Chat can be used to communicate with friends or colleagues in real-time.
- **Customer support**: Simple-Chat can be used to provide customer support by allowing customers to chat with support agents in real-time.
- **Online collaboration**: Simple-Chat can be used to facilitate online collaboration by allowing team members to communicate with each other in real-time.

#### Code Samples

```html
<div id="message-container"></div>
<form id="send-container">
  <input type="text" id="message-input" placeholder="Type your message...">
  <button type="submit" id="send-button">Send</button>
</form>
```

This code snippet shows the HTML for the chat interface.

```javascript
const socket = io('http://localhost:3000')
const messageContainer = document.getElementById('message-container')

socket.on('chat-message', data => {
  appendMessage(`${data.name}: ${data.message}`)
})

const messageForm = document.getElementById('send-container')
messageForm.addEventListener('submit', e => {
  e.preventDefault()
  const message = messageInput.value
  socket.emit('send-chat-message', message)
  messageInput.value = ''
})
```

This code snippet shows the JavaScript for the client-side functionality.
